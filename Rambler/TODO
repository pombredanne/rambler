Needed optimizaitons:

Every corba request on an entity creates a brand new
entityServantClass in order to service the single request. It might be
more efficient to keep the entityServantClass around for awhile, maybe
in an LRU in case that it's need again. This would also avoid extra
look-ups in the database. Concurrency issues will need to be thought
about. 


The interfaces on entities are very fine grained, we need to implement
some course grain interfaces to reduce network trafic problems.


The IdentityManager needs to be moved from itbe to Rambler, since the
next step is to have the Locators consult the Identity manager before
invoking methods on objects.
